🧠 Function Overview
Glotera is a cross-application translation assistant for macOS that allows you to quickly translate and replace the original text in any input field or selected text.
It supports multiple triggering methods, suitable for both input and reading scenarios.

🚀 How to Use
🔤 Input Translation
• After entering content in any input field, specify the target language (100+), and it will automatically translate and replace the original text.
• Supports the following triggering methods:

1. Type @language code or #language code (e.g., @en or #ja), then double-click the spacebar to initiate the translation.
2. Pressing the enter key directly after inputting will automatically translate and send (this only works in chat software clients; you can disable this feature in the settings if not desired).
3. Use the mouse or Cmd+A to select all input content, then click "Translate to" in the pop-up menu or any other language you wish to translate to.

📄 Reading Translation
• In non-input areas such as web pages, selecting any text will pop up a translation overlay that quickly displays the corresponding language content.

⚙️ Personalization Settings
• In Settings, you can customize the triggering commands for any language (e.g., change @zh-tw to @tw).
• If you do not want the enter key to trigger translation, you can disable this feature in the settings (⚠️ Remember to click Save after making changes).
